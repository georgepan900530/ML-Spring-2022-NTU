In this homework, I have used the ensemble technique, thus, there are several ipynb files in the zip file, each of it represent a different model. In these files, I have changed the directory for saving model to my google drive. Thus, one should change the saving path to their desired one when running the code. Also, there's a ipynb file called "ML_HW7_ensemble" which is for the final ensemble procedure. In this file, one should change the paths of trained models to their own paths inorder to successfully run the ensemble code.
